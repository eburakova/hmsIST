CHANGE or CHECK in hmsist scripts:

--lbdirect
--sione
--sitwo
--sithree (if 4D)

cd to the right directory


	FID:
	-- 1st line: file name 
	-- 2nd line: -xN, -yN and -zN. For NUS: yN = 4 for 3D; 8 for 4D, zN = number of lines in NUS file; aN = 0 (for 4D). For US: number of complex points (always even)
	-- 3rd line: xT = 1/2xN; yT, zT, aT = yN, zN, aN
	-- for NUS -yMODE and -zMODE should be Real; for US should be set accordingly
	-- Check SW
	-- Check CAR
	-- ndim = 3 for 3D and 4D

If you don't want your files to be called "test%04d.***" make sure you changed the names everywhere! 
Expression %04d tells the shell to incriment filename within the range 0000-9999, so that means you can have up to 10000 files of this type. 

	FT1PHASE: 
	-- set EM as $lbdirect
	-- remove other weighting functions
	-- set PS -p0 and -p1 to 0
	-- Better don't use baseline correction

	FT1:
	-- set PS -p0 and -p1 according to those in FT1PHASE. For NUS: set p1 to 0 or 180!!!
	
	IST:
	-- check path to the "istHMS" script and nuslist; make sure istHMS has executive permissions
	-- number of iterations
	-- when using reconstruction in parallel, check files "parallel" and "runistcluster3D (...4D)
	-- -xN, -yN and -zN must be numbers of REAL points
	-- -verb 1 is recommended

	PH2PIPE:
	--check you have "phf2pipe" script, it has permissions and the path to it is correct

	PROJPHASE:
	--set ZF size to $sione / $sitwo / $sithree accordingly
	--Second: ZF -size 
	--PS -p0 0 and -p1 to 0 
	--Choose window functions
	--Do not use baseline correction! (Remove the line '| nmrPipe  -fn POLY -auto -ord 5 -x1 25ppm -xn -20ppm   \' if it is there) 
		---For it does not do anything useful. While sometimes it simply lifts some fragments over the baseline ehich makes your spectrum looks "  

	FT2-, FT3- and FT4PHASE:
	--set PS accordingly
	--check that ZF is calling for the according variable
	--Set window functions according to those chosen in PROJPHASE step
	--Make sure there is no baseline correction
	
	FTALL:
	--Set phase (PS) accordingly
	--Check ZFs are calling for the corresponding variables
	--Set window functions according to those chosen in PROJPHASE step
	--Make sure there is no baseline correction
	
	CCPNMR:
	--Reset the filename of your *.ft and *.ucsf files as you wish
	--Make sure you have "pipe2ucsf" in the directory with all scripts OR you don't use it
