# hmsIST NUS reconstruction

hmsIST is a Harvard Medical School implementation of the Iterative Soft Thresholding algorithm of reconstruction of Non-Uniformly Sampled NMR data. 

This repository stores all the necessary programs to reconstruct the NUS NMR data (up to 4D) which is processed (Fourier-transformed) in the direct dimension. Those tools work in conjunction with [NMR Pipe](https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/). 

The programs were developed by [Wagner Lab](https://gwagner.hms.harvard.edu/) at Harvard and I did no contribution to their development. Since they can be distributed freely but are not publically accessible, I put them here for archiving purposes.
